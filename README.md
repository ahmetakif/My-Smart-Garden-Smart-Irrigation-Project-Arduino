# My-Smart-Garden-Smart-Irrigation-Project-Arduino

This is an arduino based smart watering system for plants. This project consists of sensors such as DHT11, LDR, and soil moisture sensor that measures the properties of the surrounding environment to decide how much water will go to the plant by doing calculations on the Arduino, and thus motorized valve that controls the water flow, gives sufficient hydration to the plant. The device has a 9g Towerpro servo for the valve. The mechanical structure is 3D printed.
